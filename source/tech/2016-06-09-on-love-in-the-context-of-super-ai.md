title: On Love in the Context of Super AIs

> [@cogmission](https://discourse.numenta.org/u/cogmission): Super AIs will be at "Enlightenment", and at that level, I humbly assert in my small mind that the only truth there is - is unification; that we are all one and of the same fabric and integrity, wholeness - love - is all there is because it is the fundamental ingredient. It is where we come from.

Love is real when we are in it, it lasts for only the rare tiny moments. It does last longer, but only in its subsided form. Just as @cogmission points out, [Enlightenment](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/) " is constantly re-acquired (in the moment)". It's an emerge of multiple sources of perceptual cognition, rational knowledge, emotional impulses, and precious memories.

Personally, I am strongly affected by Reductionism and Materialism and would have the tendency to break things down to their building blocks and consider the interactions and dynamics.

For example: Love can be viewed biologically as just the result of secreted chemicals which fade faster than pure spiritual form in our belief; Love can also be viewed psychologically as seeking similar elements to our self-projection in others or the resolution of our kink, and they cannot evolve covariantly over time.

I would also break Ethics into some form of Utilitarianism, consider morality as some form of wisdom, consider EQ as some form of IQ, and the list goes on. It's not that I don't have faith or enthusiasm in the pure spiritual form of these humanitarian things, it's just I feel the need of a more solid ground for preventing them to be invalidated by considerations from a realistic point of view.

This is the background why I won't jump from rapid development of AI to the singularity theory, nor from a strong AI to a super and all-power AI, nor from mental power to love and kindness. The far ends are on the extended line of logic, but there are huge gaps of many logical steps and too many variables. There's no logical inevitability but many alternate history branches.

That's why I'm forced to settle on an optimistic view for AI which also takes all these real and potentially catastrophic dangers into account. And I'd like to end this post with the following quotes:
