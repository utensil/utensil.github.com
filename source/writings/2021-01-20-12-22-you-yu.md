> 
> A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
> For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
> And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
> 
> 分享你心底隐秘的悲哀愁苦，
> 阴影叠加阴影会来得过于困厄，
> 淹没掉灵魂中清醒的创痛。
> 
> If thy mistress some rich anger shows,
> Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
> And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
> 
> 倘若你的恋人对你嗔怒，
> 只须将她的柔手执起，由着她倾吐诉说，
> 再深深地，深深地啜饮她美眸的清纯。
> 
> Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
> Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
> His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,
> And he among her cloudy trophies hung.
> 
> 尽管唯有咀嚼过欢乐之酸果，
> 味觉灵敏的人方才有缘看见，
> 灵魂一旦触及她悲伤的力量，
> 便成为她的战利品，悬挂在云霄。
