> I've Got A Pain In My Sawdust
> 
>       w. Henry Edward Warner m. Herman Avery Wade
> 
> A little bisque doll and a little rag doll
> 
> And a dolly imported from France
> 
> Were sitting one day on the shelf of the store
> 
> With a doll that could wind up and dance;
> 
> 
> When all of a sudden the shopkeeper heard
> 
> A scream that rang out thro' the store,
> 
> And this was the plaint of the little bisque doll
> 
> That made such an awful uproar;
> 
> 
> I've got a pain in my sawdust,
> 
> That's what's the matter with me;
> 
> Something is wrong with my little inside,
> 
> I'm just as sick as can be.
> 
> 
> Don't let me faint, someone get me a fan,
> 
> Someone else run for the medicine man,
> 
> Ev'ryone hurry as fast as you can,
> 
> I've got a pain in my sawdust.
> 
> 
> They took her away in a hospital van
> 
> And the whole town was filled with the blues,
> 
> For ev'ryone thought it was quite an odd thing,
> 
> And the papers all printed the news;
> 
> 
> The surgeons looked wise and they all shook their heads
> 
> And asked her just where she was sick;
> 
> "I think it's 'appendisawdust'," she exclaimed,
> 
> "And won't you please do something quick?"
> 
> I've got a pain...
> 
> 
> Oh, sad was the day for the little bisque doll,
> 
> For they cut all her stitches away,
> 
> And looked for the seat of the terrible ache;
> 
> "'Twas a delicate task," they all say,
> 
> 
> For none of the surgeons had ever before
> 
> Performed on a dolly's inside,
> 
> They tried to restuff her but didn't know how,
> 
> And this was her wail as she died;
> 
> I've got a pain...

《猫和老鼠》的永恒魅力就在于，无论它们俩怎么在争斗打闹中伤害彼此，它们俩都很快就可以恢复，谁都不会被真正伤害或杀死，这使得两人可以尽情争斗打闹。而现实生活中，却不是这样。人会被真正伤害，人会死去，人的路途和心，会被事件致命地更改。这就是这个世界致命的遗憾——无法挽回。
