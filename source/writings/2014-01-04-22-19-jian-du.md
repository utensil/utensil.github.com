人类学习是未监督的感性学习和有监督的符号化学习的结合。

Instincts prior to experiences are causing faster reaction(reflected on inputs) than response which provided some sort of supervise, and built-in relevance would be providing an intial heading. But what makes a system thrilled is always some causality strucures in inputs.

Yet there is always the need to communicate with the pre-exist world in the way that the pre-exist world formed through a more complex procedure than that tiny little internal of the cognition system. Once plugged in, learning would be much faster due to the use of symbols.
