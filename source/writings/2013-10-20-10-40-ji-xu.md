Elaine Barrish:

> 『Most of life is hell. It's filled with failure and loss. People disappoint you, dreams don't work out, hearts get broken, innocent journalists die. And the best moment of life, when everything comes together, are few and fleeting.

But you'll never get to the next great moment, if you don't keep going. So that's what I do, keep going.』
