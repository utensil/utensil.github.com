It is where we come from.</p> </blockquote> <p>Love is real when we are in it, it lasts for only the rare tiny moments. It does last longer, but only in its subsided form. Just as @cogmission points out, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/">Enlightenment</a> " is constantly re-acquired (in the moment)". It's an emerge of multiple sources of perceptual cognition, rational knowledge, emotional impulses, and precious memories.</p> <p>Personally, I am strongly affected by Reductionism and Materialism and would have the tendency to break things down to their building blocks and consider the interactions and dynamics.</p> <p>For example: Love can be viewed biologically as just the result of secreted chemicals which fade faster than pure spiritual form in our belief; Love can also be viewed psychologically as seeking similar elements to our self-projection in others or the resolution of our kink, and they cannot evolve covariantly over time.</p> <p>I would also break Ethics into some form of Utilitarianism, consider morality as some form of wisdom, consider EQ as some form of IQ, and the list goes on. It's not that I don't have faith or enthusiasm in the pure spiritual form of these humanitarian things, it's just I feel the need of a more solid ground for preventing them to be invalidated by considerations from a realistic point of view.</p> <p>This is the background why I won't jump from rapid development of AI to the singularity theory, nor from a strong AI to a super and all-power AI, nor from mental power to love and kindness. The far ends are on the extended line of logic, but there are huge gaps of many logical steps and too many variables. There's no logical inevitability but many alternate history branches.</p> <p>That's why I'm forced to settle on an optimistic view for AI which also takes all these real and potentially catastrophic dangers into account. And I'd like to end this post with the following quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'<br> 'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.<br> ― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://discourse.numenta.org/t/singularity-anticipation-of-doomsday/349/19?u=utensil">⧉</a></p> </div> </div> <div class=post> <h2> <a href='/blogs/2016/05/20/on-tech-dev-and-doomsday.html'> On the Development of Technology and the Doomsday </a> </h2> <div> <p>I believe the development of technology will eventually solve problems "introduced" by technology, one way or another, as long as we're lucky to be in a timeline (in the context of multi-universe) that doesn't include self-destruction. Let's have the spirit of adventurers, and take our chances.</p> <p>New technologies would always give humanity new ways to exercise our dark side, so the risk is always there. The risk feels high because its possible catastrophic consequences, but not the probability.</p> <p>It might seem immoral to bind the fate of ordinary people to the ship of technology. On the contrary, it's even more immoral to restrict the whole humanity just because of the concern of survival, especially for the generations to come. Put a constraint on the development of technology will not only take away the potential quality of their lives but also make them vulnerable and unprepared for the inevitable higher level of survival challenges to come.</p> <p>The singularity is just another bottleneck in human history, just as the ones we left behind. It's difficult for us who live in the ease that modern technologies provide to imagine the horrifying situation without them and the twisting and winding path lead us today.</p> <p>The following quote from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-life-mistakes-young-people-make/answer/James-Altucher">a Quora answer</a> gives a historical perspective to this future issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>4.5 million tons of manure were being dropped on the streets of Manhattan in 1890, EVERY YEAR, by horses carrying people to work.</p> <p>That was the big environmental problem of the day. "NYC will be buried in horse manure by 1950!" screamed the headlines.</p> <p>It doesn't matter what your opinion about this was. None of the people living in NY solved the problem despite the 1000s of opinions.</p> <p>People with passion for mechanics in Detroit made something called a car.</p> <p>Problem solved.</p> <p>Do what YOU love to do today. Surrender to the results. The more you surrender, the more results there will be.</p> <p>The way you solve the world's problems is to solve your problems. Then trust.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's also why we need to embrace new creations and advances as early as possible. The earlier we do so, the more prepared we can be. Also, the incautious damage in the process would also be minimalized.</p> <p>Sometimes, "whether" is never the issue, "how" is.</p> <p><a href="https://discourse.numenta.org/t/singularity-anticipation-of-doomsday/349/7?u=utensil">⧉</a></p> </div> </div> </section> </article> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/javascripts/jquery-1.7.1.js?1598345399"></script> <script src="/javascripts/highlight.pack.js?1598345399"></script> <script>
