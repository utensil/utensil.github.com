Let's have the spirit of adventurers, and take our chances.</p> <p>New technologies would always give humanity new ways to exercise our dark side, so the risk is always there. The risk feels high because its possible catastrophic consequences, but not the probability.</p> <p>It might seem immoral to bind the fate of ordinary people to the ship of technology. On the contrary, it's even more immoral to restrict the whole humanity just because of the concern of survival, especially for the generations to come. Put a constraint on the development of technology will not only take away the potential quality of their lives but also make them vulnerable and unprepared for the inevitable higher level of survival challenges to come.</p> <p>The singularity is just another bottleneck in human history, just as the ones we left behind. It's difficult for us who live in the ease that modern technologies provide to imagine the horrifying situation without them and the twisting and winding path lead us today.</p> <p>The following quote from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-life-mistakes-young-people-make/answer/James-Altucher">a Quora answer</a> gives a historical perspective to this future issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>4.5 million tons of manure were being dropped on the streets of Manhattan in 1890, EVERY YEAR, by horses carrying people to work.</p> <p>That was the big environmental problem of the day. "NYC will be buried in horse manure by 1950!" screamed the headlines.</p> <p>It doesn't matter what your opinion about this was. None of the people living in NY solved the problem despite the 1000s of opinions.</p> <p>People with passion for mechanics in Detroit made something called a car.</p> <p>Problem solved.</p> <p>Do what YOU love to do today. Surrender to the results. The more you surrender, the more results there will be.</p> <p>The way you solve the world's problems is to solve your problems. Then trust.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's also why we need to embrace new creations and advances as early as possible. The earlier we do so, the more prepared we can be. Also, the incautious damage in the process would also be minimalized.</p> <p>Sometimes, "whether" is never the issue, "how" is.</p> <p><a href="https://discourse.numenta.org/t/singularity-anticipation-of-doomsday/349/7?u=utensil">⧉</a></p> <section class=meta> <p> <span class=author> <a href='/'>宋皿</a> </span> <span class=time> <time datetime='2016-05-20 00:00:00 +0800'> 2016-05-20 </time> </span> </p> <p> <span class=license> Published under <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/' rel=license>(CC) BY-NC-ND</a> </span> <span class=tags> tagged with <a href='/tech/tags.html#tag-英文'> 英文 </a> </span> </p> </section> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
